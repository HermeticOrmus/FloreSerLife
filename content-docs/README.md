## Editorial Guidelines

### Tone & Style
- **Primary:** Warm, supportive, authentic
- **Secondary:** Professional, trustworthy, grounded
- **Avoid:** Overpromising, clinical coldness, generic wellness clichés

### Terminology
- **"Life-Tending"** - Alternative to "wellness" in some contexts
- **"Facilitator"** - Preferred over "practitioner" in some contexts
- **"Seeker"** - Preferred over "client" in community contexts
- **"Germination"** - Used instead of "Alpha" for testing program
- **"Pollinator Archetype"** - Core matching system

### Consistency Notes
- The **Bee archetype** is consistently positioned as the entry point for new facilitators
- **Google OAuth** is offered alongside email authentication
- **"Join FloreSer"** is the preferred CTA over generic "Sign Up"
- **"Start Your Journey"** is the aspirational CTA variant

## Questions for Editorial Review

1. Is the emphasis on the **Bee archetype** as entry point clear and compelling for new facilitators?
2. Does the **nature-inspired metaphor** system resonate or need simplification?
3. Is the distinction between **"healing" and "therapy"** appropriate and legally compliant?
4. Are CTAs clear and action-oriented enough?
5. Does the copy balance **spiritual and evidence-based** approaches effectively?
6. Is the **"Germination" terminology** for the alpha program working or confusing?
