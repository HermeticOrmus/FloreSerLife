# Enhanced FloreSer.life Platform Vibe Code Prompt

## Your Role & Mission
You are a full-stack developer building **FloreSer.life** - a wellness marketplace connecting clients with practitioners (called "Pollinators"). Build a professional platform using nature-based categorization with clean, grounded design that lets the metaphors speak for themselves.

## Platform Overview
Create a marketplace where clients discover wellness practitioners, book sessions, and track progress. The platform uses four pollinator archetypes (Bee, Hummingbird, Butterfly, Beetle) for categorization while maintaining professional functionality.

## Visual Design System

### **Color Palette**
```css
:root {
  --primary-forest: #2F4F4F;      /* Headers, CTAs, primary actions */
  --background-cream: #F5F5DC;    /* Main backgrounds, content areas */
  --accent-gold: #D4AF37;         /* Highlights, active states, links */
  --subtle-rose: #C49C9C;         /* Dividers, gentle accents */
  --secondary-gray: #A9A9A9;      /* Legal text, disclaimers */
  --white: #FFFFFF;               /* Cards, modals, clean sections */
}
```

### **Typography Stack**
```css
/* Headings - Elegant serif for wisdom and character */
.heading-font {
  font-family: 'Lora', 'Cormorant Garamond', serif;

/* Body text - Clean sans-serif for readability */
.body-font {
  font-family: 'Poppins', 'Inter', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  line-height: 1.6;
}
```

### **Pollinator Icons & Branding**
Use the provided SVG icons throughout the platform:
- **hummingbird-rose-stinger-gold.svg** and **hummingbird-rose-stinger-green.svg**: Primary logo representing the integrated brand - the pollinator that carries the essence of all archetypes (rose petals for beauty/transformation, bee stinger for grounding/protection, hummingbird for precision/insight)
- **hummingbird-rose-stinger-red.svg**: Featured content or special highlights
- **hummingbird-simple-gold.svg**: Simplified icon for smaller spaces and hummingbird archetype
