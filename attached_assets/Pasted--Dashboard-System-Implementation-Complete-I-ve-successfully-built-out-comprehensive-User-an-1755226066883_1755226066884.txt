 Dashboard System Implementation Complete! 🎉

  I've successfully built out comprehensive User and Practitioner
  Dashboards for FloreSer with the following components:

  🏗️ Core Infrastructure

  Shared Components:
  - DashboardLayout - Flexible layout with header, sidebar, and main
  content
  - StatCard - Reusable metric display cards with icons and trends
  - ActivityFeed - Timeline of recent user activities
  - QuickActions - Context-aware action buttons
  - UpcomingSessions - Session management with status tracking
  - DashboardSidebar - Role-based navigation with user profile

  👤 Client Dashboard Features

  - Session Management: Upcoming sessions, booking history
  - Quick Stats: Sessions, messages, favorite practitioners
  - Quick Actions: Book sessions, browse practitioners, manage profile
  - Activity Timeline: Session completions, messages, bookings
  - Wellness Journey: Progress tracking and recommendations

  🩺 Practitioner Dashboard Features

  - Business Metrics: Earnings, client count, ratings, session stats
  - Schedule Management: Today's sessions, availability status
  - Client Relationships: Message handling, session notes
  - Performance Analytics: Weekly stats, reviews, availability

  🔄 Smart Routing System

  - Role-based routing: Automatically directs users to appropriate
  dashboard
  - Flexible navigation: Direct routes to specific dashboards
  - Header integration: Role-aware dropdown menus
  - TypeScript safety: Extended user type with roles and profiles

  🎨 Design System

  - Consistent theming: FloreSer brand colors (forest, cream, gold,
  sage)
  - Responsive design: Mobile-first approach with grid layouts
  - Interactive elements: Hover states, loading states, badges
  - Accessibility: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation

  🔧 Technical Implementation

  - TypeScript safety: Extended user interface with role information
  - Component reusability: Shared components between dashboards
  - Mock data integration: Ready for API integration
  - Error handling: TypeScript compilation passes

  The dashboard system is now ready for user testing and can easily be
   connected to real API endpoints as the backend develops further.
  Each dashboard provides a comprehensive view tailored to the user's
  role while maintaining consistent UX patterns across the platform.
