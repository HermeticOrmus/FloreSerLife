Task: Integrate Platform Survey Page into FloreSer Wellness Marketplace
I need you to create a new survey page for my FloreSer wellness marketplace platform to gather user feedback on pricing and features. This should integrate seamlessly with our existing codebase and styling.
Tech Stack Context:

Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
Backend: Express.js + TypeScript, PostgreSQL (Neon), Drizzle ORM
Auth: Replit Auth with JWT tokens
Architecture: Full-stack monorepo (client/server/shared folders)

Requirements:

Database Schema: Create a new table survey_responses with fields for:

User identification (if logged in) or anonymous tracking
All form responses (demographics, pricing feedback, feature preferences)
Submission timestamp
Response categorization (facilitator/client/both/exploring)


Frontend Implementation:

Create /survey route in the React app
Use existing shadcn/ui components (forms, buttons, inputs, checkboxes, radio groups)
Match FloreSer's design system and color scheme
Implement conditional logic to show relevant sections based on user type
Add form validation using Zod schemas
Mobile-responsive design


Backend API:

Create POST /api/survey endpoint
Validate input with Zod schemas
Store responses in PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
Return success/error responses


Admin Panel Integration:

Add survey results view to existing admin interface
Display aggregated data and individual responses
Export functionality for analysis



Form Questions to Include:
[Full list of 18 questions from the original form - demographics, facilitator pricing, client preferences, Community Garden feedback, etc.]
Key Features:

Progress indicator
Conditional question display based on user type selection
Form persistence (save draft responses)
Thank you page with next steps
Analytics tracking for completion rates

Design Guidelines:

Follow FloreSer's nature-inspired aesthetic

Smooth transitions between sections

Please implement this as a complete feature branch with proper TypeScript types, error handling, and integration with the existing authentication system.
